# Basic Sample Fullstack web3.0 project built with Next.js, Polygon, Solidity, The Graph, IPFS, and Hardhat

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It follows the example project in https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-web3-development-4g74

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
